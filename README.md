### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my Github. For those that don't know me, my name is Debbie O'Brien and I am a Senior Program Manager at Microsoft. If you love Nuxt or are new to Nuxt and want to learn more about it then hopefully I will be able to help you learn more about Nuxt. My website is opensource so feel free to clone it and play around. It is not always perfect but it is where I try out new and cool things. I also break things so be warned. And I create tutorials and demos so keep watching this space. You never know what you might find.

I am a [Microsoft Most Valuable Professional](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5003613?fullName=Debbie%20O%27Brien), [Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-debbie_o_brien), [Github Star](https://stars.github.com/profiles/debs-obrien/), [Auth0 Ambassador](https://auth0.com/ambassador-program), [Nuxt Ambassador](https://nuxtjs.org/team), and [Media Developer Expert](https://cloudinary.com/mde).

🥋 Fun fact: I am a 4th degree Taekwondo Black Belt and I love sport, running, cycling, skiing....
