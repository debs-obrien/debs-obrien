### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my Github. For those that don't know me, my name is Debbie O'Brien and I am Head Developer Advocate at [Bit](https://bit.dev). If you love Nuxt or are new to Nuxt and want to learn more about it then hopefully I will be able to help you learn more about Nuxt. My code is opensource. It is not always perfect but it is where I try out new and cool things. I also break things so be warned. And I create tutorials and demos so keep watching this space. You never know what you might find. I have also just starting learning React and TypeScript and will be showing you lots of new cool stuff. Can't wait.

I am a [Microsoft Most Valuable Professional](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5003613?fullName=Debbie%20O%27Brien), [Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory/profile/profile-debbie_o_brien), [Github Star](https://stars.github.com/profiles/debs-obrien/), [Auth0 Ambassador](https://auth0.com/ambassador-program), [Nuxt Ambassador](https://nuxtjs.org/team), and [Media Devleper Expert](https://cloudinary.com/mde).

🥋 Fun fact: I am a 4th degree Taekwondo Black Belt and I love sport, running, cycling, skiing....
